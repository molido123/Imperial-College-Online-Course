# Tutorial 2: Basic Data Processing and ML

**Note:** Python 3.x is required to run this code. All files can be run independently.

This exercise contains 1 python file to sample the original csv file (**sampling.py**), plus 2 other exercise files.

**data_imputation.py** this is the data imputation exercise file that contains a few objectives described in the file.
**ml_pipeline.py** this is the file containing a basic Machine Learning pipeline in PyTorch. The objective of the
exercise is to predict the species of
the iris flower based on the length of the sepal and petal. Several objectives are shown as comments in the file.

## Libraries

- pandas: ```pip install pandas```
- sklearn: ```pip install sklearn scikit-learn```
- pytorch: ```pip install torch``` (see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
